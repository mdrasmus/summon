=============================================================================
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The following third party packages are needed for SUMMON:
    - SDL
    - GLUT

This software is available for all major platforms.  See below for platform
specific instructions:


=== LINUX (Debian)

On Debian Linux the following apt-get command should install the third party
packages:

    apt-get install libsdl-dev freeglut-dev


=== MAC OS X
Using fink to install third party packages:

    /sw/bin/fink install sdl glut

=============================================================================
CROSSPLATFORM INSTALLATION WITH DISTUTILS (Ideally)

To install summon with python distutils use the following command:

    python setup.py install

or to install in your home directory use:

    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME


=== MAC OS X
For installing on Mac OS X use the following command:
    
    python setup-macosx.py install


=============================================================================
INSTALL WITH MAKE


=== LINUX MAKE
You can also use the Makefiles to install summon in the source directory.
On Linux, you may run:

    make
    
On cygwin use the following command:

    make -f Makefile.cygwin

On both Linux and Cygwin, you must add the summon source directory to your 
python path using:

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/summon-XXX/lib


=== WINDOWS MAKE
On windows, you can run nmake with the properly setup environment variables. 
You will likely need to edit Makefile.win first to configure the location of 
third party libraries.

    <<edit Makefile.win>>
    nmake -f Makefile.win

For convenience, you can use winsh.bat to run the above command in a proper
environment for Microsoft Visual Studio 8:

    winsh.bat nmake -f Makefile.win


=== WINDOWS CYGWIN MAKE

I have had trouble using setup.py for installing on CYGWIN, so I made a Makefile
specifically for installing on CYGWIN  Use the following to install on CYGWIN.  
Note: make sure that the development packages of freeglut and SDL are installed
first.


    make -f Makefile.cygwin
