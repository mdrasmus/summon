SUMMON - visualization protyping python module
Copyright 2005-2008 Matt Rasmussen 


To install SUMMON, do the following:
    1. install thrid-party libraries
    2. install SUMMON by one of these strategies
        1. distutils (ex: python setup.py install)
        2. binary install (rpm, *.exe)
        3. Makefile

For more documentation see doc/summon_manual.pdf


=============================================================================
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The following third party packages are needed for SUMMON:
    - SDL
    - GLUT

This software is available for all major platforms.  See below for platform
specific instructions:


=== LINUX (Debian)
On Debian Linux the following apt-get command should install the third party
packages:

    apt-get install libsdl-dev freeglut-dev

Other Linux distributions should have the same packages under similar names

=== MAC OS X
Using fink to install third party packages:

    /sw/bin/fink install sdl glut
    
=== WINDOWS (XP, Vista) NATIVE
Download the windows version of GLUT from http://openglut.sourceforge.net/
Make sure to copy OpenGLUT.dll to your C:\windows\system32 directory (or wherever
your DLLs are located)

Download the windows version of SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/
Make sure to copy SDL.dll to your C:\windows\system32 directory (or wherever your
DLLs are located)


=== WINDOWS (XP, Vista) CYGWIN

SUMMON can also be installed in a Cygwin environment.  The following packages
can be installed through Cygwin's setup.exe 

    Python/python
    Libs/freeglut
    Devel/gcc-g++
    Devel/automake
    Devel/make

SDL must be compiled and installed manually from http://www.libsdl.org/


=============================================================================
CROSSPLATFORM INSTALLATION OF SUMMON WITH DISTUTILS (Ideally)

Download and unzip the archive summon-XXX.tar.gz from
http://people.csail.mit.edu/rasmus/summon
Within the uncompressed directory do one of the following:

=== UNIX (ex: Linux)
To install summon with python distutils use the following command:

    python setup.py install

or to install in your home directory use:

    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME


=== MAC OS X
For installing on Mac OS X use the following command:
    
    python setup-macosx.py install


=== WINDOWS
It is recommended to use the Windows Install available from the SUMMON website
(see below for more).

However, if you are _really_ interested in using distutils, a windows specific
version of the distutils file (setup-windows.py) is available.  You may need to
edit it to properly configure the headers and linking of third part libraries
(OpenGLUT, SDL, OpenGL).

I have found that using mingw32 and the command
    python setup-windows.py build --compiler=mingw32
works best.  Although, Visual Studio 7.1 should also work.


=============================================================================
SUMMON BINARY INSTALL

=== LINUX RPM
Download the rpm from the summon website

rpm -i summon-XXX-1.i386.rpm


=== WINDOWS 
Download and run the Installer summon-XXX.win32-py2.4.exe

For source code examples, you still need to download and unzip the tar file,
summon-XXX.tar.gz



=============================================================================
SUMMON INSTALL WITH MAKE


=== LINUX MAKE
You can also use the Makefiles to install summon in the source directory.
On Linux, you may run:

    make
    

Next, you must add the summon source directory to your python path using
(assuming you use the bash shell, add these lines to your ~/.bashrc file):

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/summon-XXX/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:path/to/summon-XXX/bin


=== WINDOWS MAKE
On windows, you can run nmake with the properly setup environment variables. 
You will likely need to edit Makefile.win first to configure the location of 
third party libraries.

    <<edit Makefile.win>>
    nmake -f Makefile.win

For convenience, you can use winsh.bat to run the above command in a proper
environment for Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0:

    winsh.bat nmake -f Makefile.win



=== WINDOWS CYGWIN MAKE
I have had trouble using setup.py for installing on CYGWIN, so I made a Makefile
specifically for installing on CYGWIN.  
Note: make sure that the *development* packages of freeglut and SDL are
installed first.  
Then execute make with the following command


    make -f Makefile.cygwin

Next, you must add the summon source directory to your python path using
(assuming you use the bash shell, add these lines to your ~/.bashrc file):

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/summon-XXX/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:path/to/summon-XXX/bin
