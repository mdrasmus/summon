SUMMON Example Usage

These examples introduce the basic features of SUMMON.  They have been numbered
by increasing complexity.  For a good tutorial, you can read each example and
execute it through python.

Examples can be executed either directly

    ./01_basics.py

Or with python and the interactive flag

    python -i 01_basics.py

Or within the IDLE program supplied with the default Python install.

The directories summatrix and sumtree contain examples specifically for the
summatrix and sumtree scripts (located in summon/bin/).  The advance directory
contains examples of experimental features in SUMMON.
