SUMMON Example usage

These examples are provided to introduce the basic features of SUMMON.  They have
been numbered by their complexity.  For a good tutorial, you can read each
example and execute it through python.

Examples can be executed either directly

    ./01_basics.py

Or with python and the interactive flag

    python -i 01_basics.py


The directories summatrix and sumtree contain examples specifically for the
summatrix and sumtree scripts.  The advance directory contains examples of
the experimental features of SUMMON.
