These directions are for installing from the WIN32 archive to a WIN32
system, such as Microsoft Windows '98.  The included files provide a
complete (less documentation and source) installation of OpenGLUT in
precompiled form for WIN32.  The libraries have been compiled with MSVC
version 6.

It is assumed that you have a C or C++ compiler, an OpenGL implementation,
and appropriate headers and libraries for building C or C++ OpenGL applications.

A complete installation involves three steps.  The steps are simple, but we
do not have any install wizard for you at this time.  Sorry.  Not all users
need perform a complete installation.  You should be able to perform each step
by dragging icons.

1) Copy the *.h files to the compiler's OpenGL include directory.
   This may be something like:

     c:\program files\Microsoft Visual Studio\include\GL

   When using OpenGLUT, you should use #include lines of the form:

     #include <GL/openglut.h>

   ...noting that "GL" is capitalized, the slash (/) is a normal
   slash, and "openglut.h" is all lower case.  Following these
   conventions will keep your code a little more portable.

2) Copy the *.lib files to the compiler's library directory.  This may be
   something like:

     c:\program files\Microsoft Visual Studio\lib

   (Note the lack of a "\GL" suffix.)

3) Copy the *.dll file to wherever your system or OpenGL DLL files are.
   (Opinions seem to differ about the proper place to put these.  Probably
    any directory under, e.g., c:\windows where you already have one or
    more working DLL files.)


Steps 1 and 2 are most important for software developers.  Developers
can skip 3 if they will be using static-linked executables.

Step 3 should be the only required step for end-users who need to install
OpenGLUT in order to use some application.

Programming documentation is not included in this archive.  The OpenGLUT
releases have generally had tandem openglut-*-doc releases with extensive
documentation.  You can also find web versions of the documentation on the
web, along with numerous examples.  For web-based documentation, point

Thanks for trying OpenGLUT!
