#
# This script starts python in interactive mode without having to specify '-i'
# This allows one to start a script with 
#    #!/usr/bin/env python-i
#
# Without this script one would have to fully specify the path of python
#    #!/usr/bin/python -i
#
# This is because only one argument is allowed in the #! line 
# Trying to use 
#   #!/usr/bin/env python -i
#
# will result in execl('/usr/bin/env', 'python -i') and will fail.

python -i $*
