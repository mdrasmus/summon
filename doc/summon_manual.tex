\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


\subsection{What is SUMMON}

SUMMON is a general visualization program that uses an embedded python engine to
allow customization through scripting.  This allows the user to rapidly
prototype a custom visualization for their data, without the overhead of a
designing a graphical user interface or recompiling native code.  By simplifying
the task of designing a visualization, the user can spend more time on
understanding their data. 

SUMMON was deisgned with several philosophies.  First, recompilation should
be avoided in order to speed up the development process.  Second, design of
graphical user interfaces should also be avoided.  Designing a good interface
takes planning and time to layout buttons, scrollbars, and dialog boxes.  Yet a 
poor interface is very painful to work with. Even when one has a good interface,
rarely can it be automated for batch mode.  Instead SUMMON relies on the
python terminal for most interaction.  This allows the user direct access to the
underlining code, which is more expressive, and can be automated through
scripting.  

Lastly, SUMMON is designed to be fast.  Libraries already exist for
accessing OpenGL in python.  However, python is relatively slow for real-time
interaction with large visualizations (trees with 100,000 leaves, matrices with
a million non-zeros, etc.).  Therefore, all real-time interaction is handled
with natively compiled C++ code.  Python is only executed in the construction 
and occasionaly interaction with the visualization.  This arrangement provides 
the best of both worlds.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installing SUMMON}
\label{sec:installing}

Before running or compiling SUMMON, following libraries are required:
\items {
    \item python 2.3 (or greater)
    \item GL/GLU    
    \item glut 
    \item SDL (for threading)
    \item pthread (for linux only)
    \item readline/ncurses
    \item cygwin (for windows only)
}

Precompiled versions of summon are available in summon/bin for linux
(\code{summon}) and windows (\code{summon.exe}).  To install SUMMON either add
\code{summon/bin} to your \code{PATH} environment variable or copy all the
programs in \code{summon/bin} to a directory on your \code{PATH}.  Windows users
should use the CYGWIN linux environment for windows (http://www.cygwin.com/) in
order to run SUMMON.

\subsection{Compiling SUMMON}

To compile you own version of SUMMON use the Makefile available under 
\code{summon/}. 

To compile the linux version change into the \code{summon/} directory and
execute the following command.

\codeblock{\$ make}

To copy the compiled linux version of SUMMON to \code{summon/bin}

\codeblock{\$ make install}

To compile the windows version of SUMMON and copy it to \code{summon/bin}

\codeblock{\$ make summon.exe}

\section{Using SUMMON}
\label{sec:using}

SUMMON should be run from the commandline.  I recommend Windows users to use
CYGWIN for running SUMMON from the commandline.  SUMMON itself takes a single
optional python script as an argument.  On execution, SUMMON opens a OpenGL
window and evaluates any script that it is given in the python engine. After
evaluation, the SUMMON prompt should appear which provides direct access to the
python engine.  Users should be familar with the python language in order to use
SUMMON.

\codeblock{usage: summon [python script]}


The SUMMON prompt acts exactly like the python prompt except for the OpenGL
window and the appearence of a builtin module called \code{summon}.  All of the
commands needed to interact with the visualization are within the \code{summon} 
module.  

To learn how to use SUMMON, example scripts have been provided in the 
\code{summon/examples/summon/} directory.  Examples of full fledged
visualiztions, SUMMATRIX and SUMTREE, are also given in the \code{summon/bin/}
directory.  Their example input files are given in
\code{summon/examples/summatrix/} and \code{summon/examples/sumtree/},
respectively.



\subsection{Example Script}

For an introduction to the basic commands of SUMMON, let us walk through the
code of the first example.  To begin, change into the
\code{summon/examples/summon/} directory and open up \code{example1.py} in a
text editor.  Also use SUMMON to execute the example with following command.

\codeblock{\$ summon example1.py}

The visualization should immediately appear in your OpenGL window.  The
following controls are available:

\vspace{.1in}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    left mouse button          & scroll \\
    right mouse button         & zoom \\
    Ctrl + right mouse button  & zoom x-axis \\
    Shift + right mouse button & zoom y-axis \\
    arrow keys                 & scroll \\
    Shift + arrow keys         & scroll faster \\
    Z                          & zoom in \\
    z                          & zoom out \\
    h                          & home (make all graphics visible) \\
    l                          & toggle anti-aliasing \\
    p                          & output SVG of the current view \\
    Ctrl + p                   & output PNG of the current view \\
    q                          & quit \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{.2in}



In your text editor, the example \code{example1.py} should contain the 
following python code:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
# SUMMON examples
# example1.py - basic commands

# make summon commands available
from summon import *

# syntax of used summon functions
# add_group( <group> )   : adds a group of graphics to the screen
# group( <elements> )    : creates a group from several graphical elements
# lines( <primitives> )  : an element that draws one or more lines
# quads( <primitives> )  : an element that draws one or more quadrilaterals
# color( <red>, <green>, <blue>, [alpha] ) : a primitive that specifies a color


# clear the screen of all drawing
clear_groups()

# add a line from (0,0) to (30,40)
add_group(group(lines(0,0, 30,40)))

# add a quadrilateral
add_group(group(quads(50,0, 50,70, 60,70, 60,0)))

# add a multi-colored quad
add_group(group(quads(
    color(1,0,0), 100, 0,
    color(0,1,0), 100, 70,
    color(0,0,1), 140, 60,
    color(1,1,1), 140, 0)))


# add some text below everything else
add_group(group(
    text("Hello, world!",    # text to appear
         0, -10, 140, -100,    # bounding box of text
         "center", "top")))    # justification of text in bounding box

# center the "camera" so that all shapes are in view
home()
}


\end{verbatim}
}

As you can see, the first line of python imports all of the SUMMON functions
from the \code{summon} module into the current environment.  The first of such
functions is the \code{clear\_groups()} command.  All graphics are added and
removed from the screen in sets called {\em groups}.  Groups provide a way to
organize and reference graphical elements.  On construction a group receives a
unique id number that can be used to refer to it in the future.  The
\code{clear\_groups()} function removes all groups that may be on the screen.

The next line of python code in the example adds a single line to the screen. 
The line is created with the \code{lines} function, which takes a series of
numbers specifying the end-point coordinates for the line.  The first
two numbers specify the x and y coordinates of one end-point (0,0) and the last
two specify the other end-point (30,40).  Next, the line is placed in a group
using the \code{group} function which returns a group ready to be added to the
screen.   Lastly, the \code{add\_group} function is called on the group.  This
function finally places the line on the screen.

The next line in the example adds a quadrilateral to the screen with the
\code{quads} command.  The arguments to the \code{quads} function are similar to
the \code{lines} function, except four vertices (8 numbers) are specified.  Both
functions can draw multiple lines and quadrilaterals (hence their plural names)
by supplying more coordinates as arguments.

The third group illustrates the use of color.  Color is stateful, as in OpenGL,
and all vertices that appear after a color object in a group will be affected. 
The \code{color} function creates a color object.  Color objects can appear
within graphical elements such as \code{lines} and \code{quads} or directly
inside a group.  Since each vertex in this example quad has a different color,
OpenGL will draw a quadrilateral that blends these colors.

Lastly, an example of text is shown.  Once again the text is added to the screen
using the \code{add\_group} function.  The arguments to the text function
specify the text to be displayed, a bounding box for the text specified by two
opposite  coordinates, and then zero or more justifications ("center", "top",
etc.) that will affect how the text aligns in its bounding box.  There are
currently three types of text: \code{text} (bitmap), \code{text\_scale} (stroke),
\code{text\_clip} (stroked text that clips).  The bitmap text will clip if it
cannot fit within its bounding box.  This is very useful in cases where the user
zooms out very far and no more space is available for the text.

The final function in the script is \code{home()}.  \code{home()} causes the
SUMMON window to scroll and zoom such that all graphics are visible.  This is a
very useful command for making sure what you have drawn is visible in the
window.

This is only a simple example.  See the remaining scripts for examples of
SUMMON's more powerful features.
