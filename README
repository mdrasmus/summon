1. INSTALL WITH DISTUTILS

To install summon with python distutils use the following command:

    python setup.py install

or to install in your home directory use:

    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME



2. INSTALL WITH MAKE

You can also use the Makefiles to install summon in the source directory.
On Linux, you may run:

    make
    
On cygwin use the following command:

    make -f Makefile.cygwin

On both Linux and Cygwin, you must add the summon source directory to your 
python path using:

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/summon-XXX/lib


On windows, you can run nmake with the properly setup environment variables. 
You will likely need to edit Makefile.win first to configure the location of 
third party libraries.

    <<edit Makefile.win>>
    nmake -f Makefile.win

For convenience, you can use winsh.bat to run the above command in a proper
environment for Microsoft Visual Studio 8:

    winsh.bat nmake -f Makefile.win
