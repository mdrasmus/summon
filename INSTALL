=============================================================================
CROSSPLATFORM INSTALLATION (Ideally)


To install summon with python distutils use the following command:

    python setup.py install



or to install in your home directory use:

    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME


=============================================================================
CYGWIN INSTALLATION

I have had trouble using setup.py for installing on CYGWIN, so I made a Makefile
specifically for installing on CYGWIN  Use the following to install on CYGWIN.  
Note: make sure that the development packages of freeglut and SDL are installed
first.


    make -f Makefile.cygwin
