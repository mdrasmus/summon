For easing Windows installation, two third party packages are also included
under the windows directory.  OpenGLUT and SDL  have their own copyrights and
licenses, which are listed in windows/openglut/ and windows/sdl/ directories, 
respectively.

To install third party libraries, copy windows/lib/OpenGLUT.DLL and
windos/lib/SDL.DLL to C:\windows\system32 (or equivalent).

Directory Layout: 

windows/include/    -- include files for third party packages
windows/lib/        -- library files for third party packages
windows/sdl/        -- copyright and license info for SDL
windows/openglut/   -- copyright and license info for OpenGLUT
