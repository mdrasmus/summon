SUMMON - visualization protyping python module
Copyright 2005-2008 Matt Rasmussen 


To install SUMMON, do the following:
    1. install third-party libraries
    2. install SUMMON by one of these strategies
        1. distutils (ex: python setup.py install)
        2. binary install (rpm, *.exe)
        3. Makefile

For more documentation see doc/summon_manual.pdf


=============================================================================
1. THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

The following third party packages are needed for SUMMON:
    - SDL
    - GLUT

This software is available for all major platforms.  See below for platform
specific instructions:


=== 1.1 LINUX (Debian)
On Debian Linux the following apt-get command should install the third-party
packages:

    apt-get install libsdl-dev freeglut-dev

Other Linux distributions should have the same packages under similar names


=== 1.2 MAC OS X
Using fink to install third party packages:

    /sw/bin/fink install sdl glut
    

=== 1.3 WINDOWS (XP, Vista) NATIVE

For your convenience, the ZIP archive of SUMMON includes compiled third-party
libraries.  To install them, copy summon/windows/lib/OpenGLUT.DLL and
summon/windows/lib/SDL.DLL to  your C:\windows\system32 directory (or wherever
your DLLs are located).

    Installation directly from third-party:
    
    If the above instructions do not work for you, you can also install
    third-party libraries downloaded directly from third-parties:

    1. Download the windows version of GLUT from
    http://openglut.sourceforge.net/ Make sure to copy OpenGLUT.dll to your
    C:\windows\system32 directory (or wherever your DLLs are located)

    2. Download the windows version of SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/ Make sure
    to copy SDL.dll to your C:\windows\system32 directory (or wherever your DLLs
    are located)


=== 1.4 WINDOWS (XP, Vista) CYGWIN

SUMMON can also be installed in a Cygwin environment.  The following packages
can be installed through Cygwin's setup.exe 

    Python/python
    Libs/freeglut
    Devel/gcc-g++
    Devel/automake
    Devel/make

SDL must be compiled and installed manually from http://www.libsdl.org/


=============================================================================
2. CROSSPLATFORM INSTALLATION OF SUMMON WITH DISTUTILS (Ideally)

Download and unzip the archive summon-XXX.tar.gz from
http://people.csail.mit.edu/rasmus/summon
Within the uncompressed directory do one of the following:

=== 2.1 UNIX (ex: Linux)
To install summon with python distutils use the following command:

    python setup.py install

NOTE: you  may need root permissions for system-wide installation.  To install 
in your home directory use:

    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME


=== 2.2 MAC OS X
For installing on Mac OS X use the following command:
    
    python setup-macosx.py install


=== 2.3 WINDOWS
It is recommended to use the Windows Install available from the SUMMON website
(see below for more).

However, if you are _really_ interested in using distutils, a windows specific
version of the distutils file (setup-windows.py) is available.  It is configured
by default to compile SUMMON with third-party software pre-installed in
summon/windows.

If you have Visual Studio 7.1 (the default windows compiler) the following
command should build and install SUMMON:

    python setup-windows.py install

The mingw32 compiler also works very well (and is easier to get).  You the
following commands to compile and install:

    python setup-windows.py build --compiler=mingw32
    python setup-windows.py install
   

=============================================================================
3. SUMMON BINARY INSTALL

=== 3.1 LINUX RPM
Download the rpm package from the SUMMON website

    rpm -i summon-XXX-1.i386.rpm


=== 3.2 WINDOWS 
Download from the SUMMON website and run the Installer
summon-XXX.win32-py2.4.exe

For source code examples, you still need to download and unzip the ZIP file,
summon-XXX.zip



=============================================================================
4. SUMMON INSTALL WITH MAKE


=== 4.1 LINUX MAKE
You can also use the Makefiles to install summon in the source directory.
On Linux, you may run:

    make
    

Next, you must add the summon source directory to your python path using:

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/summon-XXX/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:path/to/summon-XXX/bin
    
NOTE: this assumes you use the bash shell.  Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc 
startup file


=== 4.2 WINDOWS MAKE
A makefile for compiling SUMMON with mingw for windows is included.  The
following command will compile SUMMON:

    make -f Makefile.mingw

Be sure to add the following paths to your environment variables.

    append to PYTHONPATH path/to/summon-XXX/lib
    append to PATH path/to/summon-XXX/bin


=== 4.3 WINDOWS CYGWIN MAKE
I have had trouble using setup.py for installing on CYGWIN, so I made a Makefile
specifically for installing on CYGWIN.  
Note: make sure that the *development* packages of freeglut and SDL are
installed first.  
Execute make with the following command:

    make -f Makefile.cygwin

Next, you must add the summon source directory to your python path using

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/summon-XXX/lib
    export PATH=$PATH:path/to/summon-XXX/bin

NOTE: this assumes you use the bash shell.  Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc 
startup file
