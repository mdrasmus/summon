SUMMON: SIMPLE SINGLE-WINDOW MODE

The scripts in this directory are written in a simplier form that assumes that
only one window is present.  They are executed with the 'summon' program located
in summon/bin/.  The summon program provides the basic modules and 
automatically sets up a simple single-window mode.  In single-window mode,
object-orientation is not needed; all summon functions are available in the
global scope.

To execute a script in this directory use the following:

summon 01_basics.py

The summon program (located in summon/bin/) should be installed to your PATH.
